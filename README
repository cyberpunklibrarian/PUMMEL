PUMMEL - Processing Unclaimed Materials Manually is Essentially Lame

Written to work in conjunction with the Polaris Integrated Library System (ILS), PUMMEL is a simple script that allows a user to quickly add a fee to a patron's account for an unclaimed hold.

PUMMEL is written in AutoHotkey which can be had via:
www.autohotkey.com

To use:

1. Launch PUMMEL and select the speed you wish to work with. Medium is the best on almost all systems. Click Submit.

2. In Polaris open Cataloging -> Item Record.

3. Scan the barcode of the item you wish to apply the Unclaimed fine to. DO NOT CHECK THE ITEM IN FIRST.

4. Press CTRL ALT U.

5. Allow the script to process and add the fee.

6. When the Item Record appears and clears, you're ready to go again.
